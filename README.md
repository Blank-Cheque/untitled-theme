# How to install
## As a Gold theme
Note that you do need Gold for this to work. If you don't have Gold you can't use it. Also note that you need to be on Old Reddit for this. If you're not on Old Reddit, turn it on by going to https://new.reddit.com/settings/account and checking "Opt out of the redesign".
1. Scroll to the gold box at the bottom. Check "use reddit theme" and "use theme from /r/". Enter "bc_css" in the input box that follows. 
2. Click "save options"
3. All done! Enjoy. 

## On your subreddit
Note that this theme does NOT contain any images at this time, so you do not need to upload any images for it to work.
1. Go to http://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/about/stylesheet, where "subreddit" is replaced with the name of your sub. 
2. Copy all the text from this page: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blank-Cheque/untitled-theme/master/stylesheet.css and paste it into the editing box at the stylesheet page
3. Click "save"
4. All done! Enjoy.
